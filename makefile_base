# Script Name: makefile_base
# Author: Kristoph S. N. Naggert, Thursday August 10th 2017
# Type: Makefile

# Arguments: Name of File You Want to Make

# Execution: make (fileName)

# Overview:  The makefile builds all of the files in the pcf11 project workflow.

# Variables: All variables are held in a configuration file that can be updated and changed outside of the script.

# PAD = (Not entirely sure what this is used for)
# FAC = (Not entirely sure what this is used for)
# CPATH = Directory where all codes, scripts, and programs are located
# DPATH = Directory where all .psl files are located
# rootDir = The root directory for the project
# auxDir = Directory where all auxiliary files are located
# outDir = Directory where all files made by makefile are saved to
# faFile = fa file, located in auxDir
# faiFile = fai file, located in auxDir
# sortedFeatures = Feature file, located in auxDir
# expNm = Project prefix
# separator = string used to split up certain lines (Can be anything apart from a single '_')
